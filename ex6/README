I discussed the exercise with: 

============================
=  README for ex6: Mosaic  =
============================
A program that generates a mosaic of a picture from a set of images.

==================
=  Description:  =
==================
Requires PIL

usage: ex6.py [-h]
              image_source images_dir output_name tile_height num_candidates

Create a mosaic of a picture from a set of of images.

positional arguments:
  image_source    path to a .jpg picture - the mosaic objective.
  images_dir      path to directory containing only .jpg images - the mosaic
                  tiles.
  output_name     path of output file.
  tile_height     size in pixels of the mosaic tiles.
  num_candidates  adjusts accuracy - larger numbers lead to slower runs but
                  possibly more accurate results.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help      show this help message and exit
