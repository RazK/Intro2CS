I discussed the exercise with:

=============================
=  README for ex4: Hangman  =
=============================
A simple game of Hangman (with GUI!)

==================
=  Description:  =
==================
A python implementation of the notorious game Hangman!
Requires Pillow and Tkinter.
Developed and tested on Ubuntu 14.04.

==================================
=  How To Enable Hebrew Letters  =
==================================
Reference:

In order to enable hebrew in the game, we need to do the following:
1) Tell the environment to use UTF-8 encoding (rather than ASCII or other 
encoding standart which don't support Hebrew characters)
to do this we can add the following line in the top of hangman.py after
the python shebang:

# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

2) Add Hebrew alphabet to our list of valid letters (line 13):

HEBREW_ALPHABET = "אבגדהוזחטיותכלמנסעפצקרשת"
VALID_LETTERS_LIST = list(string.ascii_lowercase + HEBREW_ALPHABET)

3) Add some hebrew words to the file words.txt... :)

* I checked this, and it worked! Notice that Hebrew words appear 
written from left to right in the GUI.
