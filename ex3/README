I had 2 ideas to improve my prime's exercise:
1) Store the prime number calculated each run in a persistent way for re-use 
without calculation in future runs (using python shelve for example), I 
didn't know if it is permited to create files on the testing server and did 
not want to get in trouble in case I caused the tester to call unaothorized 
methods, and it also seemed like an overkill, so I didn't implement that... 
2) Search for prime numbers smaller than n on the internet (using urllib) 
instead of calculating them the way I did. That also seemed like an overkill 
and I could not assume the tester has authorized access to the outside www.
